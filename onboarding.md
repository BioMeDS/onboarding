# BioMeDS Group Onboarding Information

# Mission Statement

Our mission is to advance the field of (bio)medical research through the development and application of cutting-edge (bio)informatic tools. We are dedicated to unlocking the full potential of biomedical data by creating innovative methods and tools that extract valuable insights and enhance the understanding of complex biological systems.

Our primary objective is to empower researchers and practitioners worldwide, enabling them to harness the full value of their data. By providing user-friendly and powerful (bio)informatic solutions, we strive to facilitate more informed decision-making and accelerate scientific discoveries. Through collaborative efforts with experts in diverse domains, we aim to foster real-world utility and impact in the field of biomedicine.

As advocates of Open Science, we are committed to upholding the highest standards of transparency, reproducibility, and data sharing. We actively promote the dissemination of our methods and tools through publications, ensuring accessibility and facilitating their widespread adoption. We are convinced that openness and collaboration do more to advance science than competition.

BioMedical Data Science also aims to provide high-quality teaching and training to students, nurturing the next generation of (bio)medical data scientists. We believe in equipping students with the necessary skills and knowledge to excel in this rapidly evolving field. Through mentorship, workshops, and educational resources, we strive to cultivate a learning environment that fosters intellectual curiosity, critical thinking, and practical expertise.


# Expectations

**Your role:** We expect that you will take primary responsibility for the success of your research project and career development.
As a member of the lab, you are expected to participate fully in the team.
In general, lab members are free to schedule their working hours according to their own preferences.
Lab members can also freely mix attendance in the lab and home/mobile office.
Participation in scheduled meetings and events of the group and institute is generally expected.
Every member is expected to deliver high quality work, independent of when and where the work is being done.

**Markus's role:** Markus's goal is to facilitate your success as well as that of your project.

**Deadlines:** 
Abstracts for meetings must be shared with all co-authors at least one week prior to the deadline for submission.
Failure to abide by this guideline will result in missing whatever the opportunity in question is.

**Code of Conduct:** All members of the lab, along with visitors, are expected to agree with this code of conduct.
We will enforce this code.
We expect cooperation from all members to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.
The lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof).
We do not tolerate harassment of lab members in any form.
Sexual language and imagery is generally not appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations, or discussions.
However, do note that we work on biological matters so work-related discussions of e.g. animal reproduction are appropriate.
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Markus Ankenbrand immediately. If Markus is the cause of your concern, Prof. Dr. Sabine Fischer is a good informal point of contact; she does not work for Markus and has agreed to mediate.
For additional resolution paths, please see the University of WÃ¼rzburg conflict management office (https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/beschaeftigte/konfliktmanagement/anlaufstellen/).

We expect members to follow these guidelines at any lab-related event.

**Authorship:** Our lab follows the [ICMJE's Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals](https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html) defintions of the roles of authors and contributors to our manuscripts.

**Ethics:** We expect lab members to be honest in scientific communications both within and outside the lab.
We expect that lab members will design experiments in a manner that minimizes both bias and self deception.
We expect that lab members will keep agreements, be careful, and share their code and results openly with the scientific community.
We expect that credit will be given where credit is due, including in scientific writing.
Plagiarism is not tolerated.
While a full enumeration of ethical considerations is outside of the scope of this document, CU provides a [document](https://www.cu.edu/ope/aps/2027) that we recommend.

In addition, please don't hesitate to raise any questions or concerns that you have at any point with Markus.

**Say 'no':** While we foster collaborations and aim to help our colleagues with any requests, time is an essential and limited resource. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully evaluate each new commitment. Declining (good) opportunities for collaboration or requests for support is a hard thing to do. But in order to make progress in existing projects, while keeping our high standards, it is inevitable. If you have to say 'no', always do so in a curteous but clear manner. Don't leave requests unanswered.
